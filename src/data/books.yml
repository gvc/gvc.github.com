- title: "An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management"
  author: "Will Larson"
  review: 3/5
  notes: >
   I think the book aims at a different level of Engineering Management than I have been exposed to. The book 
   has a lot of good references, though, which is very helpful for deeper dives in other subjects

    This books seems to have found me in the right moment. I initially read the intro only and was immediately hooked in.
    The whole framework about the conversations about what happened, about impact and about emotions is a very powerful framework to keep in mind.
    Sheila Heen, one of the authors, is also one of the authors of another book I have reviewed very well, "Thanks for the feedback".

    Very good and concise intro to systems thinking. Starts of with pretty basic concepts, such as stocks and inflows and outflows,
    but quickly adds complexity and nuance to what is being explained.
