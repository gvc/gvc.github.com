- title: "An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management"
  author: "Will Larson"
  review: 3/5
  notes: I think the book aims at a different level of Engineering Management than I have been exposed to. Sometimes the author seems to be speaking of other levels above engineering management.

  notes: >
    This books seems to have found me in the right moment. I initially read the intro only and was immediately hooked in.
    The whole framework about the conversations about what happened, about impact and about emotions is a very powerful framework to keep in mind.
    Sheila Heen, one of the authors, is also one of the authors of another book I have reviewed very well, "Thanks for the feedback".
