The PLATO project started as an automatic teaching platform but, by crafting and encouraging a community of young and curious developers to stretch the limits of the system. This was done in the 60s and 70s and using a mainframe! Definitely well worth a look at this book if you're interested in the history of computing and the internet.\nIt's also very interesting how Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay's names tend to be brought up when we talk about the beginning of personal computing.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Ken Blanchard","date_read":"2022-07-28","title":"Leading at a Higher Level: Blanchard on Leadership and Creating High Performing Organizations","review":"?/5","notes":"I didn't actually finish reading this book, I actually abandoned it. There were some interesting ideas about  understanding and communicating with the team member in which phase of development they're in, but at every other page there was a reference to another Blanchard book and I grew tired of it.\nAlso for every paragraph of concept there seemed to be pages and pages of examples that really didn't add much.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"William Gibson","date_read":"2022-07-07","title":"Ghost Territory","review":"4/5","notes":"Not as good as Pattern Recognition, but this second book on the Blue Ant trilogy is also a page turner.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"John Doerr","date_read":"2022-06-30","title":"Measure What Matters","review":"3/5","notes":"Good explanation of OKRs (of course), but there are a lot of extra chapters with anedoctal stories about implementing OKRs in different companies that felt a lot like fillers.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"William Gibson","date_read":"2022-06-14","title":"Pattern Recognition","review":"5/5","notes":"[wip]. This is the 7th book by William Gibson that I read. I can't help but be amazed by his stories. Pattern Recognition tells the story of a \"cool-hunter\", that is hired to solve a mistery. But the story, set in the real world, is full of incredible cultural references. From a weird mechanical calculator to a cool jacket, passing by a japanese movie director and french philosophers. \n"}},{"node":{"author":"Neil Postman","date_read":"2022-06-03","title":"The Disappearance of Childhood","review":"4/5","notes":"Picked this book after going on an Alan Kay binge and coming across this [list of book recommendations](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp). The list was mentioned by Alan Kay himself in a [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-Alan-Kays-favorite-books?q=alan%20kay%20book.%20).\nThe book itself proposes an interesting idea that childhood appeared when there was a separating factor between the adult world and the child's world. To prove this point he mentions the dark ages, when children (7+ years) were sent off to apprentice. When Gutemberg invented the printing press this changed. The world was divided between those who could read and those who could not. And when that happened, we could keep 'secrets' and the ugly face of society from kids.\nAfter setting this picture up he moves to how television and its visual, instead of intelectual, form of consumption is erasing this distinction.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"David Allen","date_read":"2022-05-11","title":"Getting Things Done","review":"4/5","notes":"Reading it for the second time, almost 10 years later, this felt like a breath of fresh air. The book is much more insightful than I remembered it to be. Written before smartphones were a thing the knowledge contained in it is timeless, but the book is dated because  of all the mentions of tools and briefcases.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Donella Meadows","date_read":"2022-03-12","title":"Thinking in Systems: A Primer","review":"4/5","notes":"Very good and concise intro to systems thinking. Starts of with pretty basic concepts, such as stocks and inflows and outflows, but quickly adds complexity and nuance to what is being explained.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Martha Wells","date_read":"2022-02-17","title":"Fugitive Telemetry","review":"3.5/5","notes":null}},{"node":{"author":"J.R.R. Tolkien","date_read":"2022-02-13","title":"Farmer Giles of Ham","review":"4/5","notes":null}},{"node":{"author":"Martha Wells","date_read":"2022-02-12","title":"Network Effect","review":"3.5/5","notes":null}},{"node":{"author":"Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone e Sheila Heen","date_read":"2022-02-01","title":"Conversas difíceis &mdash; Como discutir o que é mais importante","review":"5/5","notes":"This books seems to have found me in the right moment. I initially read the intro only and was immediately hooked in. The whole framework about the conversations about what happened, about impact and about emotions is a very powerful framework to keep in mind. Sheila Heen, one of the authors, is also one of the authors of another book I have reviewed very well, \"Thanks for the feedback\".\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Will Larson","date_read":"2022-01-10","title":"An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management","review":"3/5","notes":"I think the book aims at a different level of Engineering Management than I have been exposed to. The book  has a lot of good references, though, which is very helpful for deeper dives in other subjects\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
