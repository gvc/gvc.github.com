The book  has a lot of good references, though, which is very helpful for deeper dives in other subjects\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone e Sheila Heen","date_read":"2022-02-01","title":"Conversas difíceis &mdash; Como discutir o que é mais importante","review":"5/5","notes":"This books seems to have found me in the right moment. I initially read the intro only and was immediately hooked in. The whole framework about the conversations about what happened, about impact and about emotions is a very powerful framework to keep in mind. Sheila Heen, one of the authors, is also one of the authors of another book I have reviewed very well, \"Thanks for the feedback\".\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Martha Wells","date_read":"2022-02-12","title":"Network Effect","review":"3.5/5","notes":null}},{"node":{"author":"J.R.R.

Starts of with pretty basic concepts, such as stocks and inflows and outflows, but quickly adds complexity and nuance to what is being explained.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"David Allen","date_read":"2022-05-11","title":"Getting Things Done","review":"4/5","notes":"Reading it for the second time, almost 10 years later, this felt like a breath of fresh air. The book is much more insightful than I remembered it to be. Written before smartphones were a thing the knowledge contained in it is timeless, but the book is dated because  of all the mentions of tools and briefcases.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"Neil Postman","date_read":"2022-06-03","title":"The Disappearance of Childhood","review":"4/5","notes":"Picked this book after going on an Alan Kay binge and coming across this [list of book recommendations](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp). The list was mentioned by Alan Kay himself in a [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-Alan-Kays-favorite-books?q=alan%20kay%20book.%20).\nThe book itself proposes an interesting idea that childhood appeared when there was a separating factor between the adult world and the child's world. To prove this point he mentions the dark ages, when children (7+ years) were sent off to apprentice. When Gutemberg invented the printing press this changed. The world was divided between those who could read and those who could not. And when that happened, we could keep 'secrets' and the ugly face of society from kids.\nAfter setting this picture up he moves to how television and its visual, instead of intelectual, form of consumption is erasing this distinction.\n"}},{"node":{"author":"William Gibson","date_read":"2022-06-14","title":"Pattern Recognition","review":"5/5","notes":"[wip]. This is the 7th book by William Gibson that I read. I can't help but be amazed by his stories. Pattern Recognition tells the story of a \"cool-hunter\", that is hired to solve a mistery. But the story, set in the real world, is full of incredible cultural references. From a weird mechanical calculator to a cool jacket, passing by a japanese movie director and french philosophers. \n"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
